# p5-vue-starter

This is an example of how to use [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) to bind multiple [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) sketches together, so that they can share data with each other and with other components in a single document. You can use this to build interactive webpages where input elements ike sliders and buttons can affect one or more p5 canvases on the page, or p5 sketches can affect elements on the page.

## Try it out
- [One way binding](https://aatishb.com/p5-vue-starter/one-way-binding/)
- [Two way binding](https://aatishb.com/p5-vue-starter/two-way-binding/)

In these examples, the `data` object is defined in the [Vue instance](https://github.com/aatishb/p5-vue-starter/blob/master/one-way-binding/vue-definitions.js#L47-L52), and it holds an x & y position. You can think of the Vue instance as the 'parent' or the top layer, and this is where we store shared data that we want to be accessible to multiple components. You can inspect this data in the console by typing `app.data.x` or `app.data.y`.

The input sliders are [bound to this data](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/forms.html), meaning the slider & data variables are automatically kept in sync with each other, so that changes to one automatically affect the other. You can test this by opening the console and typing `app.data.x = 100` and notice that the slider immediately updates.

Each p5 sketch is loaded using a custom `<p5>` Vue component. Any variables defined in the p5 sketch are private to that sketch and can't be accessed outside it. However, the sketches can access `data`. So, if we move the sliders, or update the value of `app.data.x`, both p5 sketches will access the updated data.

## One Way Binding Between Parent & p5 Sketch

In [this example](https://aatishb.com/p5-vue-starter/one-way-binding/), the p5 sketch reacts to data in the top layer. The p5 sketches are loaded in a [custom component](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html), created using the following command:

```
<p5 src="./sketch.js" :data="data"></p5>
```

where `sketch.js` points to the file containing the p5 code (written in ['instance mode'](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Global-and-instance-mode)), and the sketch is being passed a `data` object.

We can then access the data in the p5 sketch using the variable `parent.data`. Since this is an object, `parent.data.x` and `parent.data.y` will give you the individual x & y values.

**Tip:** Ideally, the sketches should not modify the `data` directly, in keeping with the principle of [one-way data flow](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-props.html#One-Way-Data-Flow). Although this will technically work (i.e., if you modify the parent data in the child sketch, the other components will react accordingly), this is considered a [bad practice](https://antenna.io/blog/2018/01/state-management-in-vue-js) in Vue as it can easily lead to bugs.


## Two Way Binding Between Parent & p5 Sketch

Sometimes, we might want two-way communication between the p5 sketches and the parent, where the sketches can react to the data *and* update the data as well. Instead of directly modifying the data object from the sketch, a better practice is for the sketch component to emit an update event which asks the top layer to change the data. We listen for this event in the top layer, and respond by updating the data. This sounds complicated, but Vue makes this quite easy to do.

To set this up in Vue, we need to create the p5 component as follows:

```
<p5 src="./sketch.js" :data="data" v-bind.sync="data"></p5>
```

Where the [.sync](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-custom-events.html#sync-Modifier) part tells the parent to listen to events from the p5 component and update the data accordingly.

Now, in the p5 code, if we want to change the data, we can emit an update event like this:

```
parent.$emit('update:x', 100);
```
which updates the value of `data.x` to 100. Here's [an example](https://aatishb.com/p5-vue-starter/two-way-binding/) of two way binding in action.

**Heads up:** Be careful with two way binding! It's easy to accidentally create a situation where your sketches are sending conflicting update messages. If you are using mouse/touch input, it's a good idea to check that the input is coming from within the canvas of your sketch before sending an update event, like in [this example](https://github.com/aatishb/p5-vue-starter/blob/master/two-way-binding/sketch1.js#L20-L21).

## No Binding Between Parent & p5 Sketch

If you want to create multiple *independent* p5 canvases on a single page, and you don't need to share data between components, then using a framework like Vue is probably overkill. Instead, take a look at [this tutorial](http://joemckaystudio.com/multisketches/). Howevever, you could do this here like this:

```
<p5 src="./sketch.js"></p5>
```
where we are loading the component but not passing it any data.
